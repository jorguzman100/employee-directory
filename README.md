# 🗺️ Employee Atlas

### A visual employee directory that makes searching your team a bit more interesting 😉.

Employee Atlas is a React app that pulls employee data from Random User and turns it into a searchable, sortable directory with a live Google Map view. It is built for quick lookup workflows: scan the table, filter results, click a row, and instantly see where that person is located.

## 🧩 Project Snapshot

- Modern React + Vite frontend with component-based UI for header, search, map, table, and footer.
- Node/Express server proxies employee requests through `/api/employees` to avoid production CORS issues.
- Data source order is `randomuser.me` first, then local mock fallback when Random User is unavailable.
- Google Maps JavaScript API powers geocoding, markers, and autocomplete suggestions.
- Table visibility tracking syncs the map with the rows currently in view (after search/sort/scroll).
