## The challenge

To create a employee directory with React, break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

Main elements:

- [x] React components
- [x] Google Maps
- [x] Props ans State management
- [x] Use of an external source for loading employees' data

## The development process

In order to accomplish the challenge, the following steps were done:

1. Define the purpose, and concept of the application.
2. Define the UI's main components
3. Research Google Maps for React.
4. Research other assets.
5. Create the components and the functionality.
6. Final review and proper documentation.

## The Output

With the described process we were able to create a useful and efficient single page React application.
